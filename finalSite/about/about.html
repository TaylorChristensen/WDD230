            <h1 class="heading">Our History</h1>
                <p>What do you do when you can't find fresh produce close to your home? You grow it yourself. That is exactly what Doug and Andrea 
                    Wilson started doing in 1954, when they couldnâ€™t find the produce they wanted at the local grocery stores. What started as a 
                    small effort to improve their hometown of Carlsbad, California, has since turned into a large corporation, supplying fresh produce 
                    all over California. Word traveled fast about their sustainable farming practices and their eco-friendly business model. Now, 
                    Bountiful Foods has farms all over California, to ensure that their love-grown produce makes it to your table in the freshest of 
                    conditions.

                <p>If you give a friend some fruit, they are going to want a smoothie to go with it. This sums up the start of the Bountiful Foods
